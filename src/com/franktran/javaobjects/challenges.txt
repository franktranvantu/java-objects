1. First, define a public constructor that expects a String argument named color.
(Don't worry about adding any code inside the constructor just yet, we'll do that next.)
2. Now in the body of your constructor, set the private field color to the value of the color argument
passed into the constructor. (Make sure you are setting the right color*)
3. Finally, since the color is being set in the constructor now, remove the initialization
from the field definition. Just leave it declared, but not initialized to "red".
